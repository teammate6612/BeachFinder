#Our submission for the 2022 Summer Freyhacks competition
#Creating a location finder that gives weather reports and availability

#1. we need to have a database to get all of the information from - Google Scraping
#2. we need to find beaches nearby somehow



import requests
#cache records all outputs and puts them together
cache = {}

#taking in the beach, for weather
def get_current_temp(beach):
  beach = beach.capitalize().replace(" ","+")
  weather_page = requests.get("https://www.weatherwx.com/14dayweather/"+currentState.lower()+'/' + beach + ".html").text
  search = 'style="text-align: center; font-size: 22px;">'
  if weather_page.count(search) == 0:
    print("temperature unavailable")
  else:
    beach_weather = {}
    while search in weather_page:
      weather_page=weather_page[weather_page.index(search)+len(search):]
      beach_weather = weather_page[:weather_page.index('&')]
      return "The current temperature is: "+beach_weather

#getting inputs used to pinpoint location
currentCity=input("type in the name of the city you are in>>").capitalize().replace(" ", "+")
currentState = input("type in the abbreviation of the state you are in>>")

#scraping yelp for nearby beaches
page=requests.get('https://www.yelp.com/search?cflt=beaches&find_loc=' + currentCity + '%2C+' + currentState).text

#looking for the names of the nearby beaches
search = 'class="css-1m051bw" target="_blank" name="'
if page.count(search) == 0:
  print("City not found")
else:
  if currentCity in cache:
    print(cache[currentCity])
  else:
    beach_and_weather = {}
    print("BEACHES NEAR YOU....")
    while search in page:
      page = page[page.index(search)+len(search):]
      beach_name = page[:page.index('"')]
      current_weather = get_current_temp(beach_name)
      if current_weather != "The current temperature is: ":
        beach_and_weather[beach_name] = [current_weather] 

        
      """

      1. make a seperate function maybe called get temps that takes in a beach name, and a city and returns a list
      - ideal case: returns [current temp, low temp, high temp] which are ints
      - case where google cannot find maybe just return "NOT FOUND" or an empty list? depends on you
      2. set beach_and_weather[beach_name] = get_temps(beach_name, currentState)
      
      """

results = {}

  if index == 5:
    break
  key, value = pair
